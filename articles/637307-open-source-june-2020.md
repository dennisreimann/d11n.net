# My 3rd Month of Full-Time Open Source

Code contribution-wise June has been a slower month than the ones before.
I spent quite some time with an ASP.NET project I'm currently working on, but which isn't published yet.
Nevertheless there has been the [v1.0.5.0 release of BTCPay Server](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-server-1-0-5-0/), to which I contributed the GreenField Server Info API, the Tor Onion-Location HTTP header and a refactoring or the Point Of Sale app.

We also officially launched the [new documentation](https://twitter.com/NicolasDorier/status/1277196610364043265) and mostly finished the remaining tasks on that front.
If you want to learn more, I wrote about that in detail [last month](/open-source-may-2020.html).

## In love with the Raspiblitz

My node went down with some disk corruption and I spent some time trying to fix it.
In the end I had to replace it, but was glad to do so as that brought me to the [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz).
Setting everything up I immediately [fell in love](https://twitter.com/_einundzwanzig_/status/1278545640310611970) with this project:
It's not just a nice and easy way to get your own full node up and running, but also a platform to extend and hack on.

That lead me to adding my [stacking-sats-kraken](https://github.com/dennisreimann/stacking-sats-kraken) script and [kindle-display](https://github.com/dennisreimann/kindle-display) server as bonus scripts to the Raspiblitz.
I asked for [help reviewing](https://twitter.com/DennisReimann/status/1277898277040672768) those and seeing people quickly [spinning up](https://twitter.com/emzy/status/1278015347770228737) [their own instances](https://twitter.com/grnqrtr/status/1283995575088582657) and providing feedback was a really gratifying experience.
The kindle-display project also received some PRs since then and we could refine it to a nice and simple version I think.

Other than that I've been more involved with podcasting again:
I also [printed some stickers](https://twitter.com/DennisReimann/status/1276443243694239745) and have ideas for more.
Maybe I'll come up with a sticker pack that I can set up a small shop for.

I'll definitely be coding more next month, so stay tuned for a longer report next time. 😀
